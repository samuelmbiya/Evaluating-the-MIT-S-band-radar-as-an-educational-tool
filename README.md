# Evaluating the MIT S-band radar as an educational tool
This code repository contains the code that was written to perform ISAR imaging usng the MIT S-band radar in FMCW mode. This was written for the ISAR demonstrator phase of the final year project.

## Repository information:

- mit_radar_isar_processing.m contains the code used for signal processing and ISAR image processing.

- mit_radar_generate_isar_image.m calls mit_radar_isar_processing files and allows a user to import the recorded radar dataset.

- The datasets folder contains sample test data from the dataset that was used.

## Instructions:

Run mit_radar_generate_isar_image.m to generate the ISAR images in the recorded radar data.
